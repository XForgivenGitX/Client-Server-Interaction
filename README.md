## Network library.
It implements convenient methods for reading and writing to the socket, listening to the port and connecting. As a result, all functions call a custom callback function, which takes a socket as the first argument, which allows you to continue the read/listen cycle further. 
### Features: 
#### Separate buffers for reading and writing 
#### Exception handling 
#### Correct socket shutdown.
